Before running the script, first need to change the parameters_PITA.txt/parameters_CIA.txt/parameters_RHWP.txt files to specify the parameters you need
Then in a terminal, type in "chmod +x scan.py"
After previous command, use "./scan.py +'command_type'" 
'command_type' can be 'pita' or 'PITA' or 'rhwp' or 'RHWP' or 'cia' or 'CIA'
Example:
./scan.py pita
./scan.py rhwp
./scan.py cia

The script will do the follows:
read the origin EPICS read variable and origin scandata1 values
set cleandata to NOT CLEAN(0) 
set the scandata1 value through socket
set cleandata to CLEAN(1)
wait
set cleandata to NOT CLEAN(0)
set EPICS variable to the expected value1
check if the set value is updated(only do when PITA SCAN is used)
set APPLY TO CELL variable to 1(click the button) this only do when PITA SCAN is used
check the readback value of EPICS variable
set the scandata1 value1 through socket
set cleandata to CLEAN(1)
wait
repeat as next values
After setting all the set points
set cleandata to NOT CLEAN(0)
return back the values to EPICS variable and scandata1(through socket)
set cleandata to CLEAN(1)
finish

scan.py script is calling both scan_para.py and utils.py scripts and reads the parameters_RHWP.txt/parameters_PITA.txt/parameters_CIA.txt file according to the command_type that is used, also there are instructions for the specific parameters inside the txt file.
The utils.py script requires 'cfSockCli.c' and 'cfSockCli.h' in the same directory and also 'libcfSockCli.so' file to be put in a separate directory './cfSock/'.

When the script is finished, there will be a 'SCAN finished' show in the terminal at the end, if the script is aborted mid-process, check the error.txt log
Also, when finished, you can check the log.txt log to see what have been done.
